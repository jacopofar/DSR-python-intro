    "## 9. Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting is a NumPy feature to handle different dimensions with a default behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because `a` and `b` have the same shape\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n",

    "b = 2.0\n",
    "a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case `b` is a scalar and can be see as a shape `(1, )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, numpy looks at the shape from **right to left** (assuming it's 1 if missing), and each dimension has to be 1 or the same value of the others.\n",
    "When the dimension is `1` then the value is copied (numpy calls this \"stretching\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A      (4d array):  8 x 1 x 6 x 1\n",
    "B      (3d array):      7 x 1 x 5\n",
    "Result (4d array):  8 x 7 x 6 x 5\n",
