## Introduction to most important Python concepts

Students should know about Python (at least) the following topics

- Basic datatypes and usual operations and methods to work with them
	- Numbers (including booleans)
	- Strings
	- Lists
	- Dictionaries
	- Tuples
- Difference between the different datatypes (mutability, sequences, etc)
- Opening and reading files
- if, for and while structures
- Iterations and comprehensions
- Functions and arguments, importing packages, scopes
- Anonymous functions: lambda

## Numpy
- What are numpy arrays and why we need them
- How to create different types of numpy arrays
	- From lists
	- All zeros, ones or specific value
	- From linear sequences or ranges
	- From random distributions
- Usual array attributes (size, shape, ndim, dtype, itemsize, nbytes)
- Indexing, slicing
- Reshaping, contatenating and splitting
- UFuncs
- Aggregations
- Broadcasting!! IMPORTANT!!
- Comparisons, Masks and fancy indexing

## Pandas
- What is pandas and how is it different from Numpy
- What are series and dataframes
- creating series and dataframes
- Indexes and MultiIndex
- Indexing and selecting data
- Working around missing data
- UFuncs on pandas
- Combinging datasets (concat, append, merge and join)
- Groupby and aggregations
- Pivoting tables
- String methods
